The funny gif above describe in a very percise way on of the biggest concepts of being a musician - practice makes prefection.
As a double player, practice is a main part of my day. 

For a long time i have been thinking how my knlowadge in coding and data analysis, could help me practice better. practicing every day has a potential of creating a very large amount of data, that when can use in many different ways.

This project was born from my passion to both music and data analysis, and the desire to constatnly improve in these fields. I have created a tool that analyses my prectice perforamnce, and yields useful information of how good did i practice. 

## The Chalange 

### Differences Between Electric and Double Bass

As an electric bass player for many years, playing a double bass seems like the "natural" next step. Altough similar, there are many differences between the instruments - size, playing techniques, and many more.

One of the main chalanges that exist in double bass but not i an electric bass, is the fact that double bass is fretless, meaning it has no frets. 
Frets are metal "stripes" attached to the elctric bass (or any other guitar). When positioning the finger behind some fret, a single note can be played in a percise way, since the fret location is constant. In double bass (or any other string, of fretless instrument), frest do not exist, so positioning the finger can procuce any tone, which can be not percise, if the finger position is not exactly accurate. In this situation, the double bass player should always listen to the played notes, and determine if they are accurate, high, or low, comapred to the desired note. I "Data Terms" the electric bass has "discrete" data, and the double bass has "continous" data.

The following figures show the difference between and electric and double bass.

the fingers are positiones behind the fret, so the same note is procued

the double bass is fretless, and no marlings, so one must hear to produced sound and determine if it is accurate.

### The Goal of This Project

Unlike the electric bass, playing well double bass requires the ability of hearing very perciecly, which is a very chalanging and time consuming task, that makes a lot of practice and effort.
This project was born from my will to create a tool to help me with thhis problem. This tool should:
1. Get an audio file of me playing some musical phrase with the double bass
2. Analyze the audio recording
3. Producing and analysis and score of my performance in terms of "how accurate was i in my playing in terms of pitch"
4. Comparing my corrent performance to older preformances of the same musical phrase

## The Data

Describe the data the you are working with

Few words about audio signal

Describe the "known" parameters: labels, BPM

Describe the full flow that the data is going through -> raw audio signal, metronome alignment, F0 estimation, labels alignment, error calculation, statistics calculation

## The Code

put areference to jupyter notebook:
1. how to use the code
2. describe the different parts in the code 

## Example File

choose an example file to show the process
1. show how the file was recorded (Video / Audio)
2. show the command used to run the code in order to process the file
3. show the results
4. discuss the results

## Limitations

1. run the code for "perfect" data, and show that the model has some bias 
2. discuss about model limitations - mainly the labels

## About Me

1. Few words about myself
2. My Data Science / Academic background
3. My musical background
4. Contact information
